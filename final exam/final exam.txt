#2.Insert a new borrowing record for a student (e.g., StudentID 3) for a book with the most available copies.

insert into borrowing(borrowid,studentid,isbn,borrowdate,duedate,returndate)
values(1,3,'9781234567890','2023-11-1','2023-11-8','2023-11-06');

select availablecopies
from Book

#3.Using Update Query, decrease the available copies of a book (e.g., ISBN '9781234567890') by 1 when a student borrows it.

update book set AvailableCopies = AvailableCopies - 1
where isbn = '9781234567890';

4.Retrieve the names of students who have borrowed the most books.

select s.name , max(availablecopies) as borrowingBook
from student as s
join borrowing as br on s.studentid = br.studentid
join book as b on br.isbn = b.isbn
group by s.name;

5.Retrieve the books that are overdue (i.e., the return date is before the current date).

select s.name
from student as s
join borrowing as br
on s.studentid = br.studentid
where br.returndate < br.duedate;
